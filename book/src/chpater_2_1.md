# The Console

Nearly everything on your computer is stored in *files*, and these have
different types. Documents created in word have the `.docx` file type, 
most applications (on windows at least) are `.exe`s, and images can be
`.png`s, `.jpeg`s, and many other things. JavaScript code is also generally
written in files, of the type `.js`. However, it can also be written in
an incredibly useful programming tool known as a *console*. A console
allows us to write individual lines of code and see what they output,
without having to go through the trouble doing a bunch of stuff that we
will learn in the next section.

The good news is, you already have a console on your computer! There is 
one built into every web browser, it's just a matter of knowing where to
find it. First, when you open the console on most web pages, you will
get a whole bunch of messages, so we're going to go to a page that doesn't
have anything on it at all; a special called [about:blank](about:blank).

Once there, you want to open the console. In most browsers, you do this
with the keyboard shortcut `Control+Shift+J` (on Firefox, it's 
`Control+Shift+K`). The `F12` key also usually works. 

What you now see is the console. Anything you type in there will be 
interpreted and run as JavaScript code. When you run it, you will get
back whatever your expression evaluated to. Let's start by typing with 
something simple:

```js
2 + 2
```

Hit enter, and the console should print out `4`. Congratulations, you 
now have a very expensive calculator! You can also do other mathematical
operations, such as subtracting with the minus sign (`-`), adding with 
and asterisk (`*`), and dividing with a slash (`/`). There is also another
mathematical operator you may not have heard of called modulus, which gives
you the remainder of a division, which is done with the percent sign (`%`)
(for example, `7 % 3` would evaluate to 1, because seven divided by 3 is
2 with a remainder of 1). You can also use parentheses (`()`) exactly
as you would in normal math.
